# BioSense-AI
"A Pocket-size electronic device with a Mobile app to display and analyze Body signals with a deep learning based interpretabile Multi-Model ðŸ©º" 

Project BioSense-AI is a both software - hardware project focusing on predicting diseases using ECG-PPG, temperature, and text prompts. Signals are amplified and filtered via custom analog circuits, then fed to Orange Pi Zero 2W SBC from an A2D conversion to digital processing. The system uses a deep learning custom multi-model architecture with interpretability for accuracy and efficiency. Currently, we are developing a mobile app for user access to the AI model by scanning ECG reports and other prompts for hospitals without our electronic device.

> Specifications:
- Analog circuit design for capturing ECG signals.
- Rechargeable pocket size Electronic device.
- Connects to the Mobile app to display ECG signals and prediction reports.
- Classification and predictions of Lung Sounds (by stethoscope mic);
Asthma, heart failure, pneumonia, bronchitis, pleural effusion, lung
fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- Classification and predictions of heart sounds (by stethoscope mic);
Artefact, extra heart sound, extrasystole, murmur, and normal.
- Classification and predictions of ECG; -N: Non-exotic beats (normal
beat)
